            <h3>I started ballet dancing when I was 5 years old and tap dancing when i was 6 years old. I enjoyed both types of dancing very much and performed in few dance recitals! Later, I started classical dance when I was in 1st grade. I participated in dance recitals and had fun! My cousin soon joined dance because she wanted to dance with me! I continued classical dance for 5 years until I wanted to stop. That didn't stop my hobby for dance! I still love to do contemporary and bollywood dance with my cousin! Dance helps you express yourself to the music and the beat! It lets me be me!!</h3></section>
